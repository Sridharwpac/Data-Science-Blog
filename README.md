### Installation
There is no requirement for any additional libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

### Project Details

For this project, I was interested in using FIFA 18 Dataset to address the following questions:

Question 1: Which Nation has most number of Soccer Players collected in FIFA 18, list the top 20 Nations

Question 2: How about the age distribution of the FIFA 18 Players?

Question 3: Find out the top 10 clubs with highest total player market value, and the highest average player wage

### File Description

There is one notebook file to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebook is self-explanatory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells & comments has been used to assist in understanding each and every step.

PlayerAttributeData.csv  - This file contains Player performance attributes (Overall, Potential, Aggression, Agility etc.) indexed by player id.

PlayerPersonalData.csv  - This file contains basic Player personal attributes (Nationality, Club, Photo, Age, Wage, Value etc.)

PlayerPlayingPositionData.csv - This file contains Player preferred position and ratings at all positions.

CompleteDataset.csv  - This file is the complete dataset contains all information in above three dataset.

### Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@sridhar.1983/an-insight-into-fifa-18-ed764ceda75d?source=friends_link&sk=603fd02b7047b743cc86e2e9a37bac2d).
